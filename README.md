## HIGHLIGHTS

* 30 function `BLEND` node -- subtract, multiply and overlay like the best
* Vector support for 2, 3, 4 size tuples of integer or float type
* Specific RGB/RGBA color vector support that provides a color picker
* All Image inputs support RGBA, RGB or pure MASK input
* Full Text generation support using installed system fonts
* Basic parametric shape (Circle, Square, Polygon) generator~~
* `COLOR BLIND` check support
* `COLOR MATCH` against existing images or create a custom LUT
* Generate `COLOR THEORY` spreads from an existing image
* `COLOR MEANS` to generate palettes for existing images to keep other images in the same tonal ranges
* `PIXEL SPLIT` separate the channels of an image to manipulate and `PIXEL MERGE` them back together
* `STACK` a series of images into a new single image vertically, horizontally or in a grid
* Or `FLATTEN` a batch of images into a single image with each image subsequently added on top (slap comp)
* `VALUE` Node has conversion support for all ComfyUI types and some 3rd party types (2DCoords, Mixlab Layers)
* `LERP` node to linear interpolate all ComfyUI and Jovimetrix value types
* Automatic conversion of Mixlab Layer types into Image types
* Generic `ARRAY` that can Merge, Split, Select, Slice or Randomize a list of ANY type
* `STRINGER` node to perform specific string manipulation operations: Split, Join, Replace, Slice.
* A `QUEUE` Node that supports recursing directories, filtering multiple file types and batch loading
* Use the `OP UNARY` and `OP BINARY` nodes to perform single and double type functions across all ComfyUI and Jovimetrix value types
* Manipulate vectors with the `SWIZZLE` node to swap their XYZW positions
* `DELAY` execution at certain parts in a workflow, with or without a timeout
* Generate curve data with the `TICK` and `WAVE GEN` nodes
